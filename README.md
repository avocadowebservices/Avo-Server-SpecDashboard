## 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Does it slow down my site?**  
A: Nope. Only runs in the dashboard, fetches only what’s needed, no external APIs except to get your public IP.

**Q: Does it work on any host?**  
A: Yes! Shows true server info as best it can detect. At this time, we are having issues to show on AWS instances, we'll have the fix ASAP.

**Q: Can I customize the colors or add my logo?**  
A: Fork this repo or suggest a feature!
